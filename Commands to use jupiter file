Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
Welcome to the Jupyter Notebook introductory session. You will use the Jupyter IPython Notebook as the main environment for writing Python code throughout this program and because of this reason, learning how to use the various functionalities present in the Jupyter Notebook is extremely crucial so that your coding experience going forward can be smooth. The main advantage of using Jupyter Notebook is that you can write both code and normal text (using the Markdown format in Jupyter) in the Notebooks. These notebooks are easy to read and share, and can even be used to present your work to others.

You can find the Jupyter IPython Notebook used in this session below. To open this notebook.

 Download it to your local drive.
Open the Jupyter Notebook as you have seen in the last segment, then find the file that you downloaded in point number 1 and double click on it. 
The notebook will open in a new tab; you can explore the notebook environment and get comfortable with its use.   

Using the Jupyter IPython Notebook

Here's a brief of the concepts in the notebook. 

 

Headings

# for the titles
## for the main headings
### for the subheadings
#### for the smaller subheadings
##### for the italic subheadings
Emphasis

__string__ or **string** for bold text
_string_ or *string*  for italic text
Monospace fonts

A back single quotation mark ` on both sides to get monospace fonts
Line breaks

<br> wherever you want a line break, as the notebook sometimes doesn`t give you the required line break where you want it
Indenting

> to indent the text
>> for further indenting it, and so on
Bullets and numbering

A single dash, i.e. -  followed by two spaces to make bullet points
A number and a dot followed by a space, i.e. 1. to make numbered lists
Colouring

<font color = blue, yellow, red, pink, green, etc.> String </font> to give your font any colour that you want
LaTeX Equations

$ on both the sides of the text to write LaTeX equations
Next, it is also crucial that you know about the various shortcuts while using the Jupyter Notebook. 

 

Command mode shortcuts

Esc: To go into command mode
Enter: To go back to edit mode
M: To convert a cell to a markdown cell
Y: To convert a cell back to a code cell
A: To insert a new cell above
B: To insert a new cell below
D + D: To delete cell
Z: Undo the last operation
F: To find and replace on your code
Shift + Up/Down: To select multiple cells
Space: Scroll notebook downwards
Shift + Space: Scroll notebook upwards
Edit mode shortcuts

Shift + Enter: To execute the code in the current cell and go to the next cell
Alt + Enter: To execute the code in the current cell and insert new cell below
Shift + Tab: To get a brief documentation of the object that you have just typed in the coding cell
Ctrl + Shift + -: To split the cell at the cursor
Shift + M: To merge selected cells
We have also provided a link to all the shortcuts for Mac users below.

You will slowly get used to effortlessly using these commands to write codes efficiently on your Jupyter Notebook as you move forward, so do not worry about memorising these commands all at once right
